# Advent of AI 2025 Plan

## Overview

**Advent of AI** is a 24-day coding advent calendar running from December 1-24, 2025, designed to encourage developers to explore "vibe coding" with AI assistance. Each day features a unique project prompt that builds skills progressively while showcasing the power of AI-assisted development.

## Participant Guidelines

Welcome to Advent of AI! This event is all about exploring the joy of "vibe coding" -- that magical flow state where you and your AI assistant work together to bring ideas to life quickly and creatively. Don't worry about perfect code or complex architectures; focus on building something functional and fun each day. Start with the daily prompt, but feel free to add your own creative twist. Use AI tools like Goose, ChatGPT, Claude, or others to help brainstorm, debug, and iterate. The goal isn't to become an expert in 24 days, but to experience the satisfaction of building something new every day. Share your creations, learn from others, and most importantly, have fun! Remember: done is better than perfect, and every small project teaches you something valuable.
