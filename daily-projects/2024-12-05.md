# Day 5: Random Decision Maker

**Project**: Create an app that helps make decisions  
**Vibe Focus**: Randomization and interactive elements

## Project Description

We make thousands of decisions every day, and sometimes the smallest ones can be the most paralyzing. Should you have pizza or tacos for lunch? Which movie should you watch tonight? What should you work on first? Today, you're building a delightful decision-making assistant that takes the stress out of choice and adds a bit of fun to the process.

Start with the classic approaches: a customizable wheel of fortune where users can input their options and spin for a random selection, or a magic 8-ball style interface that provides mystical guidance for yes/no questions. But think beyond simple randomization -- create a pros and cons analyzer that helps users weigh their options systematically, or build a decision tree that asks clarifying questions to narrow down choices. The key is making the experience engaging and genuinely helpful rather than just a random number generator.

The magic is in the presentation and interaction design. Add satisfying animations -- a spinning wheel with realistic physics, bouncing balls, or smooth transitions that build anticipation before revealing the result. Consider adding sound effects that make the experience more engaging, or visual themes that match different types of decisions (food choices get food-themed graphics, entertainment decisions get movie posters, etc.). Your AI assistant can help you implement smooth animations, suggest creative decision-making algorithms, and brainstorm ways to make the experience more delightful.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your decision maker into a learning system with **machine learning** that remembers your past choices and preferences, gradually getting better at suggesting options you'll actually be happy with. Add **group decision making** features with voting mechanisms for when you need to decide something with friends, family, or colleagues. For the ultimate integration, connect with your **calendar** to help schedule decisions -- "When should we have our team meeting?" becomes a smart suggestion based on everyone's availability and preferences.

## Getting Started

- Choose an engaging visual approach: wheel, cards, dice, or something more creative
- Implement smooth animations using CSS transitions or a JavaScript animation library
- Start with simple random selection, then add weighted options or filtering
- Consider different decision types: binary choices, multiple options, ranking systems
- Add local storage to remember frequently used options or decision categories
- Test the experience on mobile devices -- decision-making often happens on the go
