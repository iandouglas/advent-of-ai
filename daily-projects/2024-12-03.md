# Day 3: Personal Dashboard

**Project**: Create a simple dashboard with widgets  
**Vibe Focus**: Integrating multiple data sources

## Project Description

Your digital life is scattered across dozens of apps, websites, and services. Today, you're building a central command center that brings the most important information together in one beautiful, personalized dashboard. This project is all about learning how to integrate multiple data sources and create a interface that serves your specific needs and workflow.

Think of this as your personal mission control -- a single page that shows you everything you need to start your day or stay productive. Begin with the essentials: current time and date, local weather conditions, and perhaps a simple to-do list that persists between sessions. But the real magic happens when you start adding widgets that reflect your unique interests and needs. Maybe you want to see the latest headlines from your favorite news sources, track your local air quality, monitor cryptocurrency prices, or display inspirational quotes that change throughout the day.

The beauty of this project lies in its personalization potential. Your AI assistant can help you discover APIs for the data sources you care about most, whether that's RSS feeds from your favorite blogs, social media updates, calendar events, or even fun widgets like "this day in history" or your local sunrise/sunset times. Focus on creating a clean, organized layout that doesn't overwhelm -- each widget should serve a purpose and contribute to your daily routine rather than just adding clutter.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your dashboard into a truly smart assistant with **voice commands** that let you interact with widgets hands-free -- imagine asking "What's my schedule today?" or "Add milk to my shopping list" without touching your keyboard. Implement **smart notifications** that learn your patterns and only alert you to truly important information at the right times. For the ultimate personalization, integrate with **fitness trackers** to show your step count and health metrics, or connect to **smart home devices** to display and control your lights, thermostat, and security system right from your dashboard.

## Getting Started

- Start with a responsive grid layout that can accommodate different widget sizes
- Begin with simple widgets (time, weather) before adding complex data sources
- Use your AI assistant to find free APIs for the information you want to display
- Consider making it your browser's homepage to ensure you'll actually use it daily
- Focus on fast loading times -- a slow dashboard defeats its purpose
