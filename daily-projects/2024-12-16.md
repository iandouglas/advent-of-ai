# Day 16: Password Generator & Manager

**Project**: Secure password utility  
**Vibe Focus**: Security best practices and encryption

## Project Description

In our increasingly digital world, password security has become one of the most critical aspects of personal cybersecurity. Today, you're building a tool that addresses one of the most common security vulnerabilities: weak, reused, or compromised passwords. This project is an excellent opportunity to learn about cryptography, security best practices, and creating tools that protect user privacy while remaining usable and practical.

Start with a robust password generator that creates truly random, strong passwords using cryptographically secure random number generation. Implement customizable options for password length, character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and special requirements for sites with unusual password rules. But generation is only half the battle -- create a secure storage system that encrypts passwords locally using strong encryption algorithms, protects the master password with proper key derivation functions, and never stores passwords in plain text anywhere in the system.

The user experience challenge is making security convenient rather than burdensome. Implement features like password strength analysis that educates users about what makes passwords secure, breach detection that warns when stored passwords appear in known data breaches, and easy copy-to-clipboard functionality that doesn't leave passwords lingering in system memory. Consider adding import/export capabilities for migrating from other password managers, and always prioritize transparency about how data is stored and protected. Your AI assistant can help you implement proper encryption algorithms, understand security best practices, and design interfaces that make security feel accessible rather than intimidating.

## Stretch Goals

Elevate your password manager to professional levels with **cross-platform synchronization** using end-to-end encryption, ensuring passwords are available everywhere while remaining secure even if your servers are compromised. Add **biometric authentication** support for modern devices, allowing users to unlock their password vault with fingerprints or face recognition. For seamless integration, create **browser extension** functionality that can automatically fill passwords and generate new ones directly in web forms, making security as convenient as possible.

## Getting Started

- Implement cryptographically secure random password generation with customizable options
- Focus on proper encryption for password storage -- never store passwords in plain text
- Design a master password system with appropriate key derivation (PBKDF2, Argon2, etc.)
- Create clear visual indicators for password strength and security status
- Implement secure clipboard handling that clears sensitive data after use
- Research and follow established security practices -- don't invent your own cryptography
