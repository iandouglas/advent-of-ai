# Day 10: Word Guessing Game

**Project**: Create Wordle or Hangman variant  
**Vibe Focus**: String algorithms and game feedback systems

## Project Description

Word games have a special power to make us feel clever while expanding our vocabulary and pattern recognition skills. Today, you're building your own take on word guessing games, whether inspired by the viral success of Wordle, the classic challenge of Hangman, or your own creative twist on the genre. This project is excellent for diving into string algorithms, creating engaging feedback systems, and understanding what makes word puzzles so satisfying to solve.

If you go the Wordle route, focus on the elegant feedback system that uses color coding to guide players toward the solution -- green for correct letters in the right position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for letters not in the word at all. Implement word validation to ensure guesses are real words, create a clean grid interface that builds tension with each guess, and add the satisfying reveal animations that make each attempt feel significant. For a Hangman approach, create engaging visual representations of progress and failure, implement hint systems that provide just enough help without spoiling the challenge, and design categories that keep the game fresh and interesting.

The key to great word games is balancing challenge with fairness. Curate word lists that are challenging but not obscure, implement difficulty levels that cater to different skill levels, and create feedback systems that help players learn and improve. Consider adding features like definition lookups for completed words, streak tracking to encourage daily play, or themed word lists that focus on specific topics. Your AI assistant can help you implement efficient string matching algorithms, suggest word list curation strategies, and design feedback systems that feel encouraging rather than punishing.

## Stretch Goals

Elevate your word game with **AI-powered hint generation** that can provide contextual clues based on the current game state -- not just generic hints, but smart suggestions that guide players toward the solution without giving it away entirely. Add **custom word list creation** where players can build themed collections for friends and family, creating personalized challenges around inside jokes, professional terminology, or shared interests. For competitive word lovers, implement **real-time multiplayer word battles** where players race to solve the same puzzle or compete in turn-based word duels.

## Getting Started

- Choose your word game style and implement the core guessing mechanics first
- Create or source a good word list -- balance common words with interesting challenges
- Focus on clear, immediate feedback that helps players understand their progress
- Implement word validation to prevent invalid guesses from wasting turns
- Add visual polish with smooth animations for letter reveals and feedback
- Consider accessibility features like high contrast modes and screen reader support
