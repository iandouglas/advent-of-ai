# Day 2: Color Palette Generator

**Project**: Build a tool that generates beautiful color palettes  
**Vibe Focus**: Working with APIs and visual design

## Project Description

Colors have the power to evoke emotions, set moods, and make or break a design. Today, you're building a tool that takes the guesswork out of color selection by generating beautiful, harmonious color palettes that designers and developers can actually use. This project is perfect for exploring visual design principles while getting hands-on experience with APIs and user interface development.

Start with the basics: create a tool that can generate random color combinations using color theory principles like complementary, triadic, or analogous color schemes. Display each palette with large color swatches alongside their hex codes, and make sure users can easily copy those codes to their clipboard with a single click. The interface should be clean and inspiring -- think of it as a digital artist's palette that sparks creativity rather than overwhelming with options.

But here's where it gets interesting: consider adding the ability to extract color palettes from uploaded images. This feature transforms your tool from a simple generator into a powerful design assistant that can help users match existing brand colors or draw inspiration from photographs, artwork, or nature. Use your AI assistant to help you understand color theory, implement the palette generation algorithms, and create an interface that feels intuitive and delightful to use.

## Stretch Goals

Take your color tool to professional levels with **AI-powered palette suggestions** that understand context -- ask users to describe the mood they're going for ("energetic startup," "calming meditation app," "luxury brand") and generate palettes that match that vibe. Add **export functionality** that formats palettes for popular design tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, or CSS variables. For accessibility-conscious designers, implement **contrast checking** that ensures text remains readable across all color combinations and suggests adjustments when needed.

## Getting Started

- Begin with a simple random color generator using HSL color space for better control
- Focus on creating an appealing visual layout that showcases the colors effectively
- Research color theory basics or ask your AI assistant to explain complementary color relationships
- Consider using the HTML5 Canvas API for image color extraction or existing libraries
- Test your palettes by actually using them in a small design project
