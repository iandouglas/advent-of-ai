# Day 6: Weekend Reflection Tool

**Project**: Build a simple journaling or reflection app  
**Vibe Focus**: Data persistence and personal productivity

## Project Description

As your first week of Advent of AI comes to a close, it's time to build something that helps you pause, reflect, and gain insights from your experiences. Today's project is a personal reflection tool that makes journaling feel natural and rewarding rather than like a chore. This is your chance to create a digital space for self-discovery while learning about data persistence and thoughtful user experience design.

Begin with the core journaling experience: a clean, distraction-free writing interface where thoughts can flow freely. But make it more than just a blank page -- add guided prompts that spark meaningful reflection ("What challenged me today?", "What am I grateful for?", "What did I learn?"). Consider implementing mood tracking with simple visual indicators that help users notice patterns over time, or create a gratitude logging feature that encourages positive reflection. The goal is to make reflection feel accessible and valuable, not overwhelming or time-consuming.

The real power comes from helping users see patterns and growth over time. Store entries locally or in a simple database, and create views that let users browse their past reflections, search for specific topics, or see how their mood and insights have evolved. Your AI assistant can help you design a database schema that grows with the user's needs, implement search functionality that finds relevant past entries, and create visualizations that make personal growth visible and encouraging.

## Stretch Goals

Elevate your reflection tool with **AI-powered insights** that can analyze journal entries to identify recurring themes, suggest areas for growth, or highlight positive patterns the user might not notice themselves. Add **photo integration** that lets users attach images to entries, creating a rich multimedia journal of their experiences. For privacy-conscious users, implement **encrypted cloud backup** that keeps their most personal thoughts secure while ensuring they never lose their reflection history. Consider **mood correlation analysis** that helps users understand what activities, people, or circumstances contribute most to their wellbeing.

## Getting Started

- Design a calming, focused interface that encourages honest reflection
- Implement local storage first, then consider cloud options for data persistence
- Start with simple text entries, then add structured elements like mood tracking
- Create different types of prompts for various reflection styles (daily check-ins, weekly reviews, gratitude practice)
- Consider privacy from the beginning -- reflection tools need to feel safe and secure
- Test the experience of returning to old entries -- make browsing and searching intuitive
