# Day 1: Hello, AI World

**Project**: Create a personalized greeting app  
**Vibe Focus**: Getting comfortable with AI-assisted coding basics

## Project Description

Welcome to your first day of Advent of AI! Today's project is all about breaking the ice with AI-assisted development and creating something personal that greets you in a delightful way. This isn't just about printing "Hello World" -- we're building something that feels alive and connected to you and your environment.

Start by creating a simple web page or terminal application that knows your name and greets you warmly. But don't stop there! Make it dynamic by pulling in the current time and perhaps showing a different greeting based on whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening. Consider adding a weather component that fetches your local conditions, or integrate a random motivational quote that changes each time you visit. The goal is to create something that feels personal and useful -- your own little digital companion that brightens your day.

This project is perfect for getting comfortable with the rhythm of AI-assisted coding. Let your AI assistant help you brainstorm features, write the initial code structure, debug issues, and suggest improvements. Don't worry about making it perfect; focus on the joy of building something from scratch and seeing it come to life. Whether you choose to build it as a simple HTML page with JavaScript, a Python script, or even a mobile app, the key is to start coding and let the AI guide you through the process.

## Stretch Goals

Ready to push your greeting app to the next level? Try implementing **voice recognition** so you can simply speak your name instead of typing it -- imagine walking up to your computer and saying "Good morning" to have it respond with your personalized greeting. Add **location-based greetings** that change based on where you are in the world, perhaps showing local landmarks or cultural greetings. For the ultimate personal touch, integrate with your **calendar** to create a personalized daily agenda that shows your upcoming meetings alongside your morning coffee and weather forecast.

## Getting Started

- Choose your platform: web (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), desktop (Python, Node.js), or mobile
- Start with a basic greeting and build up from there
- Use your AI assistant to help with API integrations for weather or quotes
- Focus on making it feel personal and delightful rather than technically perfect
