# Day 15: Expense Tracker

**Project**: Personal finance tracking tool  
**Vibe Focus**: Data visualization and financial calculations

## Project Description

Money management is one of those life skills that everyone needs but few people enjoy. Today, you're building an expense tracker that makes personal finance feel manageable and even insightful, rather than overwhelming and stressful. This project combines practical data visualization with real-world problem-solving, creating something that could genuinely improve how people understand and manage their spending patterns.

Start with the core functionality that makes expense tracking actually useful: quick and easy expense entry with categories that match how people really spend money (groceries, transportation, entertainment, etc.), income logging to understand the full financial picture, and visual charts that reveal spending patterns at a glance. The key is making data entry so simple and fast that people will actually do it consistently -- consider features like recent transaction shortcuts, smart category suggestions, or even photo-based receipt capture for later processing.

The real value comes from turning raw spending data into actionable insights. Implement charts and graphs that show spending trends over time, category breakdowns that reveal where money actually goes versus where people think it goes, and budget tracking that helps users set and stick to financial goals. Consider adding features like monthly/weekly summaries, spending alerts when categories exceed budgets, or simple forecasting that shows how current spending patterns will affect future finances. Your AI assistant can help you choose appropriate chart libraries, implement financial calculations accurately, and design data visualizations that make complex information accessible.

## Stretch Goals

Modernize your expense tracker with **receipt scanning and OCR** that can automatically extract amounts, merchants, and categories from photographed receipts, eliminating the tedium of manual data entry. Add **budget alerts and predictions** powered by machine learning that can warn users when they're likely to exceed their budgets and suggest adjustments. For comprehensive financial management, integrate with **bank APIs** (where available and secure) to automatically import transactions, though always prioritize user privacy and security in financial applications.

## Getting Started

- Design a quick expense entry interface that minimizes friction for daily use
- Implement flexible categorization systems that match real spending patterns
- Focus on clear, intuitive data visualizations using charts and graphs
- Add export functionality for tax preparation or external analysis
- Ensure all financial calculations are precise and handle edge cases properly
- Consider privacy and security from the beginning -- financial data requires special care
