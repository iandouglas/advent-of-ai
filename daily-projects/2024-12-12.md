# Day 12: Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

**Project**: Real-time multiplayer game  
**Vibe Focus**: Real-time communication and multiplayer logic

## Project Description

Today marks your entry into the exciting world of real-time multiplayer gaming. While Tic-Tac-Toe might seem simple on the surface, implementing it as a live multiplayer experience introduces fascinating challenges around networking, synchronization, and user experience design. You'll be building something that connects people across the internet for shared gaming experiences, learning the fundamentals that power everything from casual mobile games to massive online worlds.

The core challenge lies in keeping two or more players synchronized in real-time. When one player makes a move, the other player should see it instantly, without lag or confusion about whose turn it is. Implement WebSocket connections for instant communication between players, create a game state that's consistent across all connected clients, and design a lobby system where players can create rooms and invite friends to join. Focus on handling edge cases gracefully -- what happens when a player disconnects mid-game? How do you prevent cheating or invalid moves?

The user experience should feel seamless and social. Players should be able to create private rooms with shareable links, see when their opponent is online and ready to play, and enjoy smooth animations that make each move feel satisfying. Consider adding features like spectator mode for watching ongoing games, a simple chat system for friendly banter, or rematch functionality that keeps the fun going. Your AI assistant can help you understand WebSocket implementation, design robust multiplayer architecture, and create user interfaces that handle network delays gracefully.

## Stretch Goals

Expand your multiplayer game into a comprehensive gaming platform with **tournament brackets** that can organize competitions among multiple players, complete with elimination rounds and winner celebrations. Add **AI opponents** with different difficulty levels, allowing players to practice against computer players when human opponents aren't available. For a unique twist, implement **3D Tic-Tac-Toe** variants that use multiple boards or cube-based gameplay, creating entirely new strategic depth while maintaining the familiar core mechanics.

## Getting Started

- Set up WebSocket connections for real-time communication between players
- Implement a simple room/lobby system for player matchmaking
- Focus on synchronizing game state across all connected clients
- Handle network edge cases: disconnections, timeouts, invalid moves
- Create a clean interface that clearly shows game status and whose turn it is
- Test with multiple devices or browser windows to simulate real multiplayer scenarios
