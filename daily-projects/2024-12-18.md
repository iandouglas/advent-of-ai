# Day 18: Meeting Notes Assistant

**Project**: Smart note-taking app  
**Vibe Focus**: Text processing and template systems

## Project Description

Meetings are where productivity goes to die -- unless you have a system for capturing, organizing, and acting on the information shared. Today, you're building a smart note-taking assistant specifically designed for meetings, transforming chaotic discussions into organized, actionable documentation. This project combines text processing, template systems, and workflow automation to solve one of the most common workplace challenges.

Start with templates that match different types of meetings: one-on-ones with sections for agenda items, discussion points, and follow-up actions; team meetings with participant lists, decisions made, and next steps; project reviews with status updates, blockers, and timeline adjustments. But don't just create static forms -- implement smart text processing that can automatically identify and highlight action items, extract participant names and responsibilities, and format notes consistently regardless of how they're entered during the meeting.

The real value comes from making notes useful after the meeting ends. Implement export functionality that can generate clean summaries in multiple formats (PDF for sharing, Markdown for documentation, task lists for project management tools), search capabilities that can find specific discussions or decisions across all past meetings, and automatic formatting that turns rough notes into professional documentation. Consider features like meeting series that link related discussions over time, participant tracking that shows who was involved in which decisions, and integration with calendar systems to automatically create meeting records. Your AI assistant can help you implement text parsing algorithms, design flexible template systems, and create export functionality that maintains formatting across different platforms.

## Stretch Goals

Elevate your meeting assistant with **real-time transcription integration** that can automatically convert speech to text during meetings, reducing the burden of manual note-taking while ensuring nothing important is missed. Add **AI-powered meeting summaries** that can analyze transcripts or notes to automatically generate executive summaries, highlight key decisions, and extract action items with assigned owners and deadlines. For seamless workflow integration, implement **automatic calendar event creation** that can schedule follow-up meetings and add action items directly to participants' calendars based on meeting outcomes.

## Getting Started

- Design flexible templates that can accommodate different meeting types and styles
- Implement text processing that can identify and format action items, decisions, and key points
- Focus on export functionality that creates clean, shareable documentation
- Add search capabilities that work across all meeting notes and history
- Consider real-time collaboration for meetings with multiple note-takers
- Test with actual meeting scenarios to ensure the tool improves rather than complicates the process
