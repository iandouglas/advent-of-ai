# Day 17: File Organizer

**Project**: Automated file management tool  
**Vibe Focus**: File system operations and automation

## Project Description

Digital clutter is the modern equivalent of a messy desk -- it slows us down, creates stress, and makes it harder to find what we need when we need it. Today, you're building an intelligent file organizer that can automatically sort, categorize, and manage files based on customizable rules. This project is perfect for learning about file system operations, automation principles, and creating tools that solve real-world problems that affect everyone with a computer.

Start with the core functionality that makes file organization actually useful: the ability to scan directories and analyze files by type, size, creation date, and content, then automatically move or copy them to appropriate destinations based on user-defined rules. Implement common organization patterns like sorting downloads by file type, organizing photos by date taken, or moving old files to archive folders. But go beyond simple sorting -- add duplicate detection that can identify identical files even when they have different names, and batch renaming capabilities that can standardize file naming conventions across large collections.

The power comes from making automation intelligent and customizable. Create a rule engine that lets users define complex conditions ("move all PDF files older than 30 days to the Archive folder") and actions, implement dry-run modes that show what would happen before actually moving files, and add undo functionality for when automation doesn't work as expected. Consider features like file preview capabilities, size analysis that identifies storage hogs, and integration with cloud storage services for comprehensive file management. Your AI assistant can help you navigate file system APIs safely, implement efficient file scanning algorithms, and design rule systems that are both powerful and user-friendly.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your file organizer into an intelligent assistant with **AI-powered content analysis** that can categorize files based on their actual content rather than just file extensions -- imagine automatically sorting documents by topic, photos by subject matter, or code files by programming language. Add **cloud storage integration** that can organize files across multiple services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) from a single interface. For ultimate automation, implement **scheduled automation** that runs organization rules automatically at specified times, keeping file systems tidy without any manual intervention.

## Getting Started

- Implement safe file system operations with proper error handling and user confirmation
- Create a flexible rule system that can handle various file organization scenarios
- Focus on performance when scanning large directories with thousands of files
- Add preview and dry-run capabilities to build user confidence in automation
- Implement comprehensive logging so users can track what was organized and when
- Consider cross-platform compatibility -- file paths and permissions work differently on different operating systems
