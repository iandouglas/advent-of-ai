# Day 11: Puzzle Platformer

**Project**: Simple 2D platformer with physics  
**Vibe Focus**: Physics simulation and character controls

## Project Description

Platform games represent one of the most fundamental and satisfying genres in gaming -- the pure joy of running, jumping, and exploring virtual worlds. Today, you're building a 2D puzzle platformer that combines precise character movement with brain-teasing challenges. This project is perfect for learning about physics simulation, character controls, and level design principles that have entertained players for decades.

Start with the core platformer mechanics: a character that can run left and right with smooth acceleration and deceleration, jump with realistic gravity and arc physics, and interact with solid platforms and obstacles. The "puzzle" element comes from designing levels that require players to think as well as react -- maybe they need to push blocks to reach higher platforms, activate switches to open doors, or collect keys in the right order to progress. Focus on making the character movement feel responsive and predictable, as frustrating controls can ruin even the most clever puzzle design.

Level design is where your creativity can really shine. Create a series of interconnected screens or a scrolling world filled with platforms, obstacles, and collectible items. Implement basic physics for moving platforms, falling blocks, or bouncing objects that add dynamic elements to your puzzles. Consider adding simple enemies or hazards that create timing challenges, and don't forget to include checkpoints or respawn systems that keep failure fun rather than frustrating. Your AI assistant can help you implement physics calculations, suggest level design patterns that create satisfying progression, and optimize collision detection for smooth gameplay.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your platformer into a creative playground with a **level editor** that lets players design and share their own challenges, turning your game into a platform for community creativity. Add **procedural level generation** that creates endless variations of your core mechanics, ensuring players always have new challenges to discover. For mobile players, implement **tilt controls** that use the device's accelerometer for character movement, creating a unique and intuitive way to navigate your puzzle world.

## Getting Started

- Implement basic character physics: movement, jumping, gravity, and collision detection
- Create a simple level structure with platforms, walls, and basic obstacles
- Focus on responsive controls that feel immediate and predictable
- Design a few test levels that gradually introduce new mechanics and challenges
- Add visual feedback for interactions: particle effects, screen shake, sound cues
- Consider using a game development framework or library to handle complex physics calculations
