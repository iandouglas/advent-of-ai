# Day 7: Classic Minesweeper

**Project**: Implement the classic Minesweeper game  
**Vibe Focus**: Game logic and grid-based interfaces

## Project Description

Welcome to game development week! Today, you're diving into one of the most beloved puzzle games of all time: Minesweeper. This project is perfect for understanding game logic, grid-based interfaces, and the satisfying challenge of implementing rules that are simple to understand but complex to master. You'll be building something that has entertained millions of people during coffee breaks and procrastination sessions.

Start with the core mechanics that make Minesweeper addictive: a grid of hidden cells, some containing mines, others containing numbers that indicate how many mines are adjacent. Players click to reveal cells, right-click to flag suspected mines, and try to clear the entire board without triggering an explosion. The challenge lies in implementing the flood-fill algorithm that automatically reveals connected empty spaces, calculating the numbers for each cell based on adjacent mines, and managing the game state as players make their moves.

Focus on creating a clean, intuitive interface that feels responsive and satisfying to interact with. Each cell should provide clear visual feedback -- unrevealed cells look clickable, numbers are color-coded for quick recognition, and flagged cells are obviously marked. Add a timer and mine counter to create that classic Minesweeper tension, and don't forget the satisfying moment when players win or the dramatic reveal when they hit a mine. Your AI assistant can help you implement the grid logic, optimize the flood-fill algorithm, and create smooth animations that make each click feel rewarding.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your Minesweeper into something unique with **custom board shapes** -- why stick to rectangles when you could have hexagonal grids, circular boards, or even irregular shapes that create new strategic challenges? Add a **multiplayer competitive mode** where players race to clear identical boards, turning the solitary puzzle into a thrilling head-to-head competition. For the ultimate challenge, implement an **AI solver** that can demonstrate optimal moves, helping players learn advanced strategies while showcasing pathfinding and logical deduction algorithms.

## Getting Started

- Begin with a simple rectangular grid and basic click interactions
- Implement mine placement first, then work on the number calculation logic
- Focus on the flood-fill algorithm for revealing connected empty spaces
- Add visual polish with hover effects, smooth animations, and clear iconography
- Test different difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, expert) to ensure balanced gameplay
- Consider mobile-friendly touch interactions alongside traditional mouse controls
