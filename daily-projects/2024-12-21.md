# Day 21: AI-Powered Content Creator

**Project**: Automated content generation tool  
**Vibe Focus**: AI API integration and content workflows

## Project Description

Welcome to the advanced applications week! Today, you're building a sophisticated content creation tool that harnesses the power of AI to help writers, marketers, and creators generate ideas, overcome writer's block, and produce high-quality content more efficiently. This project combines multiple AI APIs with thoughtful user experience design to create something that enhances human creativity rather than replacing it.

Start by integrating with popular AI APIs (OpenAI's GPT models, Claude, or others) to create a content generation engine that can produce blog post outlines, social media content, creative writing prompts, or marketing copy based on user inputs. But don't just create a simple prompt-and-response interface -- build a workflow system that guides users through the content creation process, from initial brainstorming through multiple rounds of refinement and editing. Implement features like tone adjustment (professional, casual, humorous), content length controls, and format templates that match different content types and platforms.

The real innovation comes from creating workflows that feel collaborative rather than automated. Design interfaces that let users iterate on AI-generated content, combine multiple AI responses into cohesive pieces, and maintain their unique voice and style throughout the process. Consider features like content calendars that help plan and organize generated content, SEO optimization suggestions that improve discoverability, and export functionality that formats content appropriately for different platforms (blog posts, social media, email newsletters). Your AI assistant can help you design effective prompting strategies, implement API rate limiting and error handling, and create user interfaces that make AI collaboration feel natural and productive.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your content creator into a comprehensive media production suite with **multi-modal content generation** that can create coordinated text, images, and audio content for complete campaigns or projects. Add **brand voice consistency** features that learn from existing content to maintain consistent tone and messaging across all generated materials. For professional content teams, implement **automated publishing workflows** that can schedule and distribute content across multiple platforms while maintaining appropriate formatting and optimization for each channel.

## Getting Started

- Set up API integrations with one or more AI content generation services
- Design user workflows that guide content creation from concept to completion
- Implement prompt engineering techniques that produce higher-quality, more relevant outputs
- Focus on editing and refinement tools that let users improve AI-generated content
- Add export and formatting capabilities for different content types and platforms
- Consider rate limiting, cost management, and error handling for AI API usage
