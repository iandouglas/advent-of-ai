# Day 9: Snake Game

**Project**: Build the classic Snake game  
**Vibe Focus**: Real-time game loops and collision detection

## Project Description

Few games are as instantly recognizable and endlessly playable as Snake. Today, you're building this arcade classic that has entertained players from the earliest mobile phones to modern browsers. This project is perfect for learning about real-time game loops, collision detection, and the art of creating simple mechanics that become increasingly challenging and addictive over time.

The core mechanics are elegantly simple: a snake moves continuously across the screen, growing longer each time it eats food, while the player steers it using arrow keys or touch controls. The challenge comes from avoiding walls and the snake's own growing body, creating an escalating tension as success makes the game progressively more difficult. Implement smooth movement with a consistent frame rate, responsive controls that feel immediate and precise, and clear visual feedback for food collection and collisions.

Focus on the details that make the experience satisfying: the snake should move in discrete grid steps that feel smooth and predictable, food should appear in random locations that don't overlap with the snake's body, and the collision detection should be pixel-perfect to avoid frustrating false positives. Add a scoring system that rewards longer survival and faster food collection, implement multiple difficulty levels that adjust the snake's speed, and create a high score system that encourages replayability. Your AI assistant can help you implement the game loop timing, optimize collision detection algorithms, and create smooth animations that make the snake's movement feel natural.

## Stretch Goals

Transform your Snake game into a cutting-edge experience with **webcam gesture control** -- imagine steering the snake by pointing left, right, up, or down with your finger, creating a hands-free gaming experience that feels magical. Add **voice commands** that let players shout directions ("Left! Right! Up!") for an entirely new way to play, perfect for accessibility or just pure fun. For competitive players, implement **multiplayer snake battles** where multiple snakes compete on the same board, trying to outlast each other while collecting food and avoiding collisions.

## Getting Started

- Set up a game loop that runs at a consistent frame rate (start with 60fps, adjust snake speed separately)
- Implement the snake as an array of body segments, with the head leading and tail following
- Focus on precise collision detection for walls, food, and the snake's own body
- Create responsive keyboard controls with proper key repeat handling
- Add visual polish with smooth movement animations and satisfying food collection effects
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure controls feel natural on each platform
